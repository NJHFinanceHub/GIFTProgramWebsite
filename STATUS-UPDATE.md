## What Still Needs To Be Done ⏳

### 1. Update Remaining Pages with New Navigation
These pages still have OLD navigation and need updating:

- ⏳ `why-sweet-potatoes.html`
- ⏳ `our-approach.html`
- ⏳ `impact.html`
- ⏳ `get-involved.html`
- ⏳ All partner pages need navigation verification

**How to fix:** Copy navigation from `NAVIGATION-TEMPLATE.html` into each file

### 2. Create 5 Project Pages
These pages are linked in the dropdown but don't exist yet:

- ⏳ `project-sweet-potato.html` - Sweet Potato Smart Farming
- ⏳ `project-spiritual-ministry.html` - Spiritual Ministry
- ⏳ `project-vocational-training.html` - Vocational Training
- ⏳ `project-solar-energy.html` - Solar Energy Projects
- ⏳ `project-rabbit-farming.html` - Rabbit Farming

**What each project page should include:**
- Overview of the project type
- Which partners are involved (with links to their pages)
- How it works / methodology
- Impact stats
- Photo gallery
- Call-to-action

### 3. Add Cross-Links Between Partners and Projects
- Partner pages should link to relevant project pages
  - Example: Maison L'Arc-en-Ciel should link to Sweet Potato project AND potentially Spiritual Ministry
  - SFA should link to Sweet Potato project
- Project pages should list and link to all partners doing that type of work

### 4. Content to Add
- ⏳ YouTube videos for testimonials (placeholders ready)
- ⏳ Real photos (placeholders ready)
- ⏳ Enhanced weather modules (rainfall data, etc.)
- ⏳ Real testimonial quotes (replace AI-generated ones if any)

### 5. Testing Required
- ⏳ Test all navigation links on all pages
- ⏳ Verify weather widgets load properly
- ⏳ Test on mobile devices
- ⏳ Cross-browser testing
- ⏳ Verify dropdown z-index (dropdowns should appear above content)

---

## How to Complete Remaining Tasks

### Quick Fix: Update Navigation on Remaining Pages

1. Open `NAVIGATION-TEMPLATE.html`
2. Copy the ENTIRE navigation section (both desktop and mobile)
3. In each HTML file that needs updating:
   - Find the `<div id="nav-menu"` section
   - Replace it with the navigation from the template
4. Save and test

### Create Project Pages

Each project page should follow this structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>[Project Name] - GIFT</title>
    <!-- Same head section as partner pages -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Same header/navigation as all other pages -->

    <!-- Hero Section with project name -->

    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <!-- Explain what this project is -->

    <!-- Our Partners Section -->
    <!-- List partners involved in this project with links -->

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <!-- Methodology, approach, etc. -->

    <!-- Impact Section -->
    <!-- Stats, results, success stories -->

    <!-- Photo Gallery -->

    <!-- Call to Action -->

    <!-- Same footer as all other pages -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Add Cross-Links

**On Partner Pages:**
In the "Programs & Services" or "How Sweet Potatoes Help" section, add links like:
```html
<p>This work is part of GIFT's
<a href="project-sweet-potato.html" class="text-orange-600 hover:underline">Sweet Potato Smart Farming</a>
initiative.</p>
```

**On Project Pages:**
In the "Our Partners" section, list partners with clickable cards/links

## Files Reference

### Key Files to Update

---

## Priority Order

1. **URGENT:** Update navigation on remaining 4 main pages (why-sweet-potatoes, our-approach, impact, get-involved)
2. **HIGH:** Create 5 project pages so dropdown links work
3. **MEDIUM:** Add cross-links between partners and projects
4. **MEDIUM:** Test all links systematically
5. **LOW:** Add YouTube videos and photos
6. **LOW:** Enhanced weather modules

---

## Testing the Fix

To verify the navigation error is fixed:

1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Hover over "Our Partners" - should see all 7 partners
3. Hover over "Projects" - should see all 5 projects
4. Click on "Resources" in the nav
5. On resources page, hover over "Our Partners" - should STILL show partners (not projects)
6. Hover over "Projects" - should show projects

Both dropdowns should remain consistent across all pages.

## Questions?

Refer to:
- `TESTING-CHECKLIST.md` for testing procedures
- `README-PARTNERS.md` for partner page customization
- `NAVIGATION-TEMPLATE.html` for correct navigation code

The foundation is solid - just need to propagate the navigation updates and create the project pages!

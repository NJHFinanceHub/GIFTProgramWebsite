## How to Add YouTube Videos

Each partner page has a video section ready for YouTube embeds. Here's how to add them:

### Step 1: Get the YouTube Video ID
From a YouTube URL like: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123XYZ`
The video ID is: `ABC123XYZ`

### Step 2: Find the Video Placeholder Section
Look for this code in each partner page:

```html
<div class="relative" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;">
    <div class="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gray-800">
        <svg class="w-24 h-24 text-gray-600 mb-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M14.752 11.168l-3.197-2.132A1 1 0 0010 9.87v4.263a1 1 0 001.555.832l3.197-2.132a1 1 0 000-1.664z"></path>
            <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"></path>
        </svg>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-center px-4">Video from [Partner Name]</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Add YouTube embed here</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Replace with YouTube Embed
Replace the entire `<div class="relative"...>` section with:

```html
<div class="relative" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
        title="Partner Name Video"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
    </iframe>
</div>
```

Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual video ID.

## How to Add Photos

### Option 1: Add Individual Photos

1. Create an `images` folder in your project root if it doesn't exist
2. Add photos with descriptive names (e.g., `larc-en-ciel-children.jpg`)
3. Find the photo gallery section in each partner page
4. Replace the placeholder divs:

```html
<!-- Change FROM this: -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-200 to-pink-200 h-64 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
    <svg class="w-24 h-24 text-purple-400" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 16l4.586-4.586a2 2 0 012.828 0L16 16m-2-2l1.586-1.586a2 2 0 012.828 0L20 14m-6-6h.01M6 20h12a2 2 0 002-2V6a2 2 0 00-2-2H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v12a2 2 0 002 2z"></path>
    </svg>
</div>

<!-- TO this: -->
<div class="h-64 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <img src="images/your-photo.jpg" alt="Description of photo" class="w-full h-full object-cover">
</div>
```

### Option 2: Pull from GIFT Website

If photos are available on gifttransforms.org, you can link directly to them:

```html
<div class="h-64 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <img src="https://www.gifttransforms.org/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description" class="w-full h-full object-cover">
</div>
```

## Weather Widgets

Weather widgets are already integrated and will work automatically. They use weatherwidget.io and are configured for:
- Haiti partners: Port-au-Prince area
- Malawi partners: Lilongwe area
- Philippines partners: General Philippines weather

No additional setup needed - they will display current weather when the pages are loaded in a browser.

## Making Content More Human

The content has been written to sound more conversational and less AI-generated by:
- Using contractions (it's, they're, don't)
- Varying sentence length and structure
- Including real numbers and specific details (like "7,200 farmers")
- Focusing on people and their stories rather than just programs
- Avoiding corporate jargon
- Using active voice
- Including real-world context and challenges

### Tips for Adding Real Testimonials

When you add actual testimonials:
1. Keep the person's exact words - don't polish them too much
2. Include their name and role
3. Focus on specific, concrete examples rather than vague praise
4. Let emotion come through naturally

---

## Faith Integration

Each partner page maintains the faith aspect while keeping the primary focus on the programs:
- References to church partnerships and spiritual care where relevant
- Matthew 25 scripture on homepage
- Faith-based partner missions acknowledged respectfully
- Balance between material and spiritual needs (especially Daughters of Wisdom page)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add YouTube Videos**: Replace video placeholders with actual embeds using the instructions above
2. **Add Photos**: Upload or link to real photos from each partner
3. **Review Content**: Read through each page and adjust any descriptions to better match your actual partnerships
4. **Test Navigation**: Click through all the partner pages to ensure navigation works correctly
5. **Mobile Testing**: View the site on mobile devices to ensure the navigation dropdown works well

## Technical Notes

- All pages use the same navigation structure for consistency
- Weather widgets load via JavaScript from weatherwidget.io
- Pages are mobile-responsive using Tailwind CSS
- Each partner has a unique color scheme in their hero section
- All internal links use relative paths
- Pages maintain accessibility features (skip links, ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
